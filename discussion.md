## Discussion Prompts

**Discuss with your partner:**
- What does each assertion check for? Why is it important that we have that assertion? Your TA will ask you to explain a couple of the assertions you wrote during check-off.

**Discuss with your partner:**
- What similarities and differences do you see between the assertions written for the Moore implementation vs. the assertions written for the Mealy implementation?

**Complete with your partner:**
- You and your partner should write a 1-paragraph reflection together addressing the following points:
    - How was the assertion-writing process?
    - How can you improve your assertion-writing skills? Identify weaknesses that you want to work on.
